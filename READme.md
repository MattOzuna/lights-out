## Lights Out

This is a small game I made using React. The goal of the game is to turn out all the lights!  
The app comes with a few tests created using react-testing-library and jest.  

It comes with a few scripts to make runnning the app easier.  

```
npm start //starts a server and open the browser to the correct port
npm test //will run test files
```
